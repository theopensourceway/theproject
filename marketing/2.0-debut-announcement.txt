Information About 2.0 Version
=============================

This community release of The Open Source Way, "a guidebook for community management best practices," features a number of notable new elements, including:

* New chapters. Contributors have added material on governance, inclusivity, accessibility, and project members' safety and well-being to track how community management practices are evolving.
* New sections. Guidebook material is now grouped into chapters addressing topics like "getting started," "attracting users," "guiding participants," and "growing contributors."
* Improved structure. The guidebook now offers a prescribed path for readers, and includes various checklists to enhance "focus on growing your community of users while keeping the barriers to use, participate, and contribute as low as possible."
* New format. Chapters are now collaboratively written to feature a wider range of experiences.
* Modularity. Chapters can now stand on their own as independent guides but form a cohesive story when read together, so readers can access the material and proceed however they wish.

Beyond the guidebook, the Open Source Way project is a community of practice for anyone interested in open source community management. We don't just explore what community management is and how to do it, but also discuss why we consider certain practices "best." We're a diverse group of practitioners who cultivate and curate best practices for creating, growing, and sustaining innovative open source communities. Our recently updated and published 2.0 version of The Open Source Way, our guidebook of best practices, was created as a fully open collaboration using our own recommendations in action.

"The 2.0 version of this guidebook is the culmination of a decade of discussions sparked by the 1.0 release," said Karsten Wade, primary author of the 2011 debut and lead for the 2.0 update. "Just as open source development has evolved, we wanted to evolve the way we presented best practices around managing communities of contributors. Part of that is the vision of a community of practitioners of all levels, working to understand and improve on this important work with and beyond just one guidebook. I'm thrilled as I anticipate how this community is going to expand its membership and activities over the next decade."
